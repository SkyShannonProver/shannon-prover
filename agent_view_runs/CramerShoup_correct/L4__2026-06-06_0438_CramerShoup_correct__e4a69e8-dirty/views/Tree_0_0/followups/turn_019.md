## Pure Logic — close with smt / rewrite

**Goal operators:**
- `DH.G.g`
- `Some`
- `hr`
- `None`

**Visible hypotheses:**
- `hx1: x1 \in dt`
- `hx2: x2 \in dt`
- `hy1: y1 \in dt`
- `hy2: y2 \in dt`
- `hz1: z1 \in dt`
- `hz2: z2 \in dt`

**Close with:**
- `smt(<lemmas>)` — discharge with the right lemmas (YOU pick them)
- `rewrite <eq>` / `move=> <intro>` — normalise the goal first
- `case (<cond>)` — split a disjunction / membership in the goal

**Yours:** the lemmas for `smt`, the rewrite chain, the case condition — `lookup_symbol` any operator above for its definition and lemmas.

## Status
remaining **1** · phase `ambient_logic` / `ambient_logic`

### Need more? submit one of these read-only requests
- Need parsed goal shape, resolved names, or KB pattern hints.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`
- Need local or standard-library lemma names before rewriting a pure goal.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "lemma_hints"}}`
- Need the valid EasyCrypt form for rewrite, apply, conseq, while, or SMT setup.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "tactic_forms", "name": "rewrite"}}`

**Last action:** `rewrite hc /=; have hD: (DH.G.g ^ z1 * DH.G.g ^ w ^ z2) ^ u = DH.G.g ^ u ^ z1 *…` — EasyCrypt accepted this read-only probe. The committed proof state was not changed; `goal_after_probe` shows the goal that would be visible if this tactic were committed. (The committed EasyCrypt proof state was not changed.)

## Already tried at this exact state
_(your own history at this goal + EasyCrypt's verdict — facts, not a prohibition; you decide whether a re-try is worth it)_
- commit `pose V := H k (DH.G.g ^ u, DH.G.g ^ w ^ u, (DH.G.g ^ z1 * DH.G.g ^ w ^ z2) ^ u …` → accepted
- probe `rewrite hc /=` → probed (read-only; state unchanged)
- probe `rewrite hc /=; rewrite log_bij !(logg1, logrzM, logDr); ring.` → probed (read-only; state unchanged)
- probe `rewrite hc /=; have hD: (DH.G.g ^ z1 * DH.G.g ^ w ^ z2) ^ u = DH.G.g ^ u ^ z1 *…` → probed (read-only; state unchanged)
- probe `rewrite hc /=; have hD: (DH.G.g ^ z1 * DH.G.g ^ w ^ z2) ^ u = DH.G.g ^ u ^ z1 *…` → probed (read-only; state unchanged)

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.
