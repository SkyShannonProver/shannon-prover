## ⚠️ Deep Surgery — decompose, don't grind the whole goal

**Route:** experts decompose this shape as case split then rcond swap wp conseq → local smt.

**Why now:** current pRHL state looks past the main opener: the useful next work is local branch/suffix surgery, not changing proof family.

**Confidence:** medium — The current pRHL goal has local branch/suffix surgery signals, but the exact guard or statement order still needs inspection.

**Fast track probe:** try `case: (<current branch guard>).` first — Use only when the visible goal has a concrete guard controlling the local branch.

**Where:**
- setup before the frontier (positions 1–1) — absorb with `sp`/`wp`: RealOrcls(GenChaChaPoly(OCC(IFinRO))).init()

**Toolbox:**
- `case: (<which guard>)` — split the divergent branch (YOU pick the condition).
- `rcondt{i} N` / `rcondf{i} N` — force a branch (YOU pick t/f); for a loop guard, `while(true); auto`.
- `swap [a..b] c` — line up statement order across the two sides.
- `wp` / `wp -N -N` — absorb suffix statements (from the end) before `call`/`sim`.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<the few equal vars>})` then `sim` — weaken to the equal prefix and auto-close it.
- local `smt(...)` for the residual logic.

**Avoid:**
- This is a branch-local/suffix alignment problem; a fresh restart throws away useful opener and invariant work.
- One side has sampling or instrumentation before the suffix; use `rcond`, `swap`, or one-sided `rnd` before plain `wp`.
- `sim` is usually too late/too strong before the guard and suffix shape are aligned.

**Repair if fails:**
- syntax → inspect tactic_forms for swap, rcondt, rcondf, wp, conseq, rnd, or eager
- frontier → inspect align or goal_info for statement indexes before retrying
- invariant → use undo_to_checkpoint {} and choose the checkpoint before the call/loop invariant that should carry the missing guard or size fact
- lemma → inspect lemma_hints or lookup_symbol for the local size/nth/bad-event lemma
- route → downgrade this surgery route only after a smaller prefix and relevant tactic_forms fail

**Yours:** which condition to `case` on, which way each guard resolves, the sample coupling (e.g. `t0{1} = t1{2}`), the smt lemmas.
