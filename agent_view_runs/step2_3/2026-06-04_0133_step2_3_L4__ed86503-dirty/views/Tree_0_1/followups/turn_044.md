remaining **0** · phase `closed_candidate` / `unknown`

### Need more? submit one of these read-only requests
- Need parsed goal shape, resolved names, or KB pattern hints.
  submit `{"intent": "inspect_context", "payload": {"topic": "goal_info"}}`

_(full untruncated view: `latest_workspace_view.json`)_

---

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `inspect_context`
- result: Read-only context. Accepted/rejected tactic or call text inside a preview is route-selection information, not the current proof-state error.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.
