## Opener — reduce the probability goal

**Route:** reduce `Pr[...] <= Pr[...]` to a relational/phoare judgment first.

**Framework strategy:** no pr obligation

**Reduce with:**
- `byequiv (_: <pre> ==> <post>)` — to a pRHL `equiv` (most common)
- `byphoare (_: <pre> ==> <post>)` — to a `phoare` bound on one program

**Yours:** the reduction (byequiv vs byphoare), the pre/post, the numeric bound.

## Status
remaining **2** · phase `probability` / `pr`

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `probe_tactic` `rewrite -(pr_RO_FinRO_D (fun (_:nonce*C.counter) => dblock_ll) (G4(A)) &m () (fun (r:bool…`
- result: Read-only tactic probe. Use any goal-after-probe text as a preview only; there is no probe step to undo.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.
