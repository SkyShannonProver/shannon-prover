Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `commit_tactic` `have f_eq : equiv[DoubleQuery(PRFi).f ~ DoubleQuery(Sample).f : (DoubleQuery.bad{1} <=> D…`
- result: Committed tactic accepted; the EasyCrypt proof state changed.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.
