## Call Frontier — set up the call invariant

**Situation:** the candidate named call is NOT callable at this frontier yet — blocker: `residual_after_call_site`; so step into the body or write a manual invariant.

**Candidate:**
- `lemma`

**Frontier:**
- setup before the frontier (positions 1–1) — absorb with `sp`/`wp`: DoubleQuery.bad <- true
- frontier: both sides at `r <@ PRFi.f(x)`
- frontier: both sides at `no matching left-side call at this frontier`

**Invariant must carry:**
- `={DoubleQuery.qs}`

**Frame facts at risk:**
- `={DoubleQuery.qs}` needed by current_goal but NOT carried by conseq #11 → rewind: submit `{"intent": "undo_to_checkpoint", "payload": {"checkpoint_id": "cp_11_1ece294d64ef0684"}}`

**Options:**
- `call (_: <Inv>)` — cross the call with a relational invariant (YOU write `<Inv>`)
- `inline*` / `proc` — step into the callee body instead of crossing

**Yours:** the invariant predicate; whether to cross (`call`) or step in (`inline*`).

## Status
remaining **6** · phase `relational_program` / `call_site`

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `probe_tactic` `inline*; auto; if{1}; auto; smt(dBlock_uffu).`
- result: Read-only tactic probe. Use any goal-after-probe text as a preview only; there is no probe step to undo.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.
