## ⚠️ Deep Surgery — decompose, don't grind the whole goal

**Where:**
- setup before the frontier (positions 1–1) — absorb with `sp`/`wp`: CBC_Oracle(DoubleQuery(PRFi)).init()

**Toolbox:**
- `case: (<which guard>)` — split the divergent branch (YOU pick the condition).
- `rcondt{i} N` / `rcondf{i} N` — force a branch (YOU pick t/f); for a loop guard, `while(true); auto`.
- `swap [a..b] c` — line up statement order across the two sides.
- `wp` / `wp -N -N` — absorb suffix statements (from the end) before `call`/`sim`.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<the few equal vars>})` then `sim` — weaken to the equal prefix and auto-close it.
- local `smt(...)` for the residual logic.

**Yours:** which condition to `case` on, which way each guard resolves, the sample coupling (e.g. `t0{1} = t1{2}`), the smt lemmas.

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

### Manager result (previous turn)
- you submitted: `probe_tactic` `inline*; auto; smt(fdom0).`
- result: Accepted structural transition probe. Decide whether to enter this phase using `last_result.structural_transition`; do not solve the speculative preview in your mental model, and do not call `undo_last_step` to undo a read-only probe.

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.
