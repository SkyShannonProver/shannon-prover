## Surgery — align or decompose the two sides

**Where:**
- frontier: left side only at `no matching left-side call at this frontier`
- frontier: left side only at `no matching left-side loop at this frontier`

**Toolbox:**
- `case: (<which guard>)` — split the divergent branch (YOU pick the condition).
- `rcondt{i} N` / `rcondf{i} N` — force a branch (YOU pick t/f); for a loop guard, `while(true); auto`.
- `swap [a..b] c` — line up statement order across the two sides.
- `wp` / `wp -N -N` — absorb suffix statements (from the end) before `call`/`sim`.
- `conseq(:_==> ={<the few equal vars>})` then `sim` — weaken to the equal prefix and auto-close it.
- local `smt(...)` for the residual logic.

**Yours:** which condition to `case` on, which way each guard resolves, the sample coupling, the smt lemmas.

## Status
remaining **3** · phase `relational_program` / `call_site`

**Last action:** `sp; wp.` — EasyCrypt accepted the committed tactic. (The committed EasyCrypt proof state changed.)

Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.
