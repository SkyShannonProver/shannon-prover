Submit exactly ONE proof intent via the `submit_proof_intent` MCP tool (only `intent` + `payload`; no node ids, hashes, request ids, or reasoning fields).

Compaction recovery: if these exact paths are missing from your context, refresh through `submit_proof_intent` with `{"intent":"inspect_context","payload":{"topic":"goal_info"}}` instead of using shell directory discovery for proof-state artifacts.

The current goal is shown in full above. Only-if-needed: the complete structured view (every collapsed panel) is in `LEGAL_LATEST_WORKSPACE_VIEW`.
